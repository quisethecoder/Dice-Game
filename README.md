Dice Game

This project is a fun game that was created for practice, and to get a deeper understanding of Javascript. Everytime the page is refreshed the dice will generate a random number between 1 and 6. The screen will display player 1 or 2 winning depending on which dice is higher, and if they're the same it will show a tie.

Tools Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
